Hey there. OlÃ¡ ğŸ‘‹ğŸ™‚ 

My name is Kolmar Kafran. I'm currently following a career change path. I have been working as a Data Engineer for the Brazil's Ministry of Economy for the past 3 years and I just got bored. I'm recycling myself to head into Software Engineering, specifically Mobile Development. It's a matter of fulfillment, I like to work creatively to solve people's problems ğŸŒˆğŸ¦„.
