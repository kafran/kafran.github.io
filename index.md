Hey there. OlÃ¡ ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™‚ 

My name is Kolmar Kafran and I accidentally became a Data Engineer at Brazil's Ministry of Economy. I work for the Federal Government for the past 8 years and with public management for 10 years. I have a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration and endless hours of reading and study on coding, algorithms, data structures, design patterns and data modeling. How did I end up in this field, you ask? Well, I was on the other side of the Data Rainbow ðŸŒˆðŸ¦„ working as a BI Analyst and feeling all the pain gathering, wrangling and bending the data I needed. Eventually I was good enough to others came to me to get their data. Soon the market would be calling me Data Engineer ðŸ¥³. The rest is history.
