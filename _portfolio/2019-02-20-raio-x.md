This is a project for the Brazil's Ministry of Economy. The X-Ray Dashboard provides an interactive panel which gathers information from several sources. An incredible data engineering work has been done. To build the Data Lake and the Data Warehouse which feeds the panel we had to integrate data from multiple sources and data bases.
