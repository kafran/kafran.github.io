This is a project I did for the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of the state of Para√≠ba in Brazil. This dashboard was meant for the dean to follow the strategic planning performance of the institution.

{% include gallery caption="Galery with dashboard images." %}

The dean asked for a tool which he could manipulate himself so I opted to build the dashboard using the Microsoft Office Excel.

**OBS** The _dashboard_ on this post is merely illustrative. The data on these images does not represent the IFPB's strategic planning.
